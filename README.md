## Usage

#### Install the extension in VS Code

  * Open the command palette using Ctrl+Shift+P
  * Type `ext install slm` in the command palette

#### Select Slm as a language

  * On the bottom-right corner, click on the select language mode button, if you have created a new file it should display *Plain Text*.
  * Select *Slm* in the list of languages.
  
Alternatively, saving the file with a `.slm` extension, will allow VS Code to understand that it is a Slm file, and automatically select the language correctly.
